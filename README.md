<p id="description">A classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a square with their symbol: one player uses "X" and the other uses "O." The objective is to be the first to get three of their symbols in a row either horizontally vertically or diagonally. The game ends when one player wins or when all squares are filled resulting in a draw if no player has achieved three in a row. Tic Tac Toe is simple to learn making it a popular choice for players of all ages.</p>
